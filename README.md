# Blackjack AI Assistant

## Overview

**Blackjack AI Assistant** is an advanced, educational blackjack tool that combines a React-based web interface with a Python backend powered by FastAPI. It features a sophisticated AI decision engine that uses basic strategy, true count card counting (Hi-Lo system), and professional-level deviations to provide optimal play recommendations. The project is designed for learning, training, and exploring advanced blackjack strategy.

## Strategy Used

This project uses a **hybrid blackjack strategy** that combines:

- **Basic Strategy:**  
  The mathematically optimal way to play every possible hand in blackjack, based on the player's cards and the dealer's upcard. This is the foundation for all decisions and is implemented in the backend as a set of rules.

- **Hi-Lo Card Counting System:**  
  The AI tracks the running count and true count using the Hi-Lo system, where:
  - 2–6 = +1
  - 7–9 = 0
  - 10, J, Q, K, A = -1  
  The true count is calculated by dividing the running count by the estimated decks remaining.

- **True Count Deviations (Index Plays):**  
  For certain hands, the AI will deviate from basic strategy if the true count reaches a specific threshold. For example:
  - **16 vs 10:** Stand instead of hit/surrender if the true count is 4 or higher.
  - **15 vs 10:** Stand at true count 4+.
  - **Insurance:** Only take insurance if the true count is 3 or higher.
  - Many other professional-level deviations are included.

- **Confidence & Risk Analytics:**  
  The AI provides a confidence score and advantage estimate for each recommendation, based on the true count and hand context.

## Development Approach 

1. **Backend (Python, FastAPI):**
   - Implemented the basic strategy as a Python class.
   - Built an enhanced card counter that tracks running count, true count, and deck penetration.
   - Developed a decision engine that applies basic strategy and then checks for true count deviations using a table of index plays.
   - Exposed the AI logic as a REST API using FastAPI.

2. **Frontend (React):**
   - Created a user-friendly interface for entering player and dealer cards, tracking the count, and displaying AI recommendations.
   - Integrated with the backend API to fetch real-time advice.
   - Visualized confidence, deviation, and reasoning for each decision.

3. **Testing & Simulation:**
   - Wrote unit tests to verify the AI’s decisions, including edge cases, splits, doubles, and soft hands.
   - Simulated thousands of hands to validate the strategy and counting accuracy.

4. **(Optional) Vision System:**
   - Prototyped card recognition using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to automate card counting from screenshots.

**This approach allows users to learn not just basic strategy, but also advanced card counting and professional deviations, all with clear explanations and analytics.**


## Features

- **AI Decision Engine:** Python backend with enhanced basic strategy, true count deviations, and risk/confidence analytics.
- **Card Counting:** Hi-Lo system with true count calculation, deck penetration, and running count tracking.
- **Deviations:** Professional-level index plays (e.g., 16 vs 10 stand at TC 4+, insurance at TC 3+).
- **API:** FastAPI backend exposes endpoints for AI recommendations, ready for integration with any frontend.
- **Vision System (optional):** Prototype scripts for recognizing cards from screenshots using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR.
- **Unit Tests:** Robust test suite for AI logic, including edge cases, splits, doubles, and soft hands.
